# 🛠️ 4-Cylinder Engine – SolidWorks Model

This project features a full 4-cylinder internal combustion engine modeled and assembled in SolidWorks. Each part was created from scratch to replicate real-world engine mechanics and geometry.

## 🔩 Components Included
- Pistons
- Piston Rings
- Crankshaft
- Connecting Rods with Caps
- Piston Pins

## 🎞️ Motion Study
A motion study was created to simulate the engine's crank-slider mechanism.  
A **rotational motor** was added to the crankshaft to drive the assembly and animate the pistons' movement, showcasing synchronized mechanical interaction between all components.

## 📁 Files Included
- `.SLDPRT` (individual part files)
- `.SLDASM` (assembly file)
- `.STEP` and `.IGES` (neutral 3D file formats for cross-platform compatibility)
- `.mp4` animation (engine motion driven by the crankshaft motor)

## 📌 Notes
- Project is intended for mechanical visualization and educational use  
- No combustion, valves, or timing systems included  
- Motion study focuses on the crank-slider kinematics, not dynamic force simulation
